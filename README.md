# String
Welcome to my String Library(WIP).

Uses the C language(mingw/gcc), and is free to use. If you want to use this lib in your software, I just ask you to include a reference of this repository.

***Tips***

All work here is simple and was created to be just a reference and a way to study the C language. 
Some tips you should take a look:

>You must know data structures even a bit to understand what is happening.
Good to start is understand what are arrays, lists and stacks. They probably are used here just once.

>You must know too pointers. At least the sufficient to understand reference and memory allocation.
Yeah, array sending over reference for functions and all those.

>I am using function pointers. You should take two looks to understand.
*I am not* saying you must know function pointers. You will learn it looking at the code. Just take look twice. 

And that's all.
You are free to help and send more implementations. I appreciate the help
Thanks for coming here.
